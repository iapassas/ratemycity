* Prerequisites
To run “Rating my city” web application you need the following to be installed in your host:
PHP version 5.2.4 or greater
MySQL version 5.0 or greater
The requirements have changed as of WordPress 3.2. 
It is recommended Apache or server for running WordPress, but any server that supports PHP and MySQL will do.


* Ten steps installation
1.	Create a MySQL DB to your localhost with the name “dimos_thessalonikis”
2.	Create an admin user for the above “dimos_thessalonikis” MySQL database
3.	Download the db_dimos_thessalonikis.zip file which contains the MySQL DB
4.	Import that db_dimos_thessalonikise.zip file into your local MySQL server
5.	Download the file “wp_dimos_thessalonikis.zip”
6.	Extract the contents of the “wp_dimos_thessalonikis.zip” into a sub directory of your local web server. Now you should have a subdirectory into your web server called “dimos_thessalonikis”.
7.	Modify the wp-config.php file in the directory “dimos_thessalonikis” with the data of the admin user you have declared in step 2 i.e.
/** MySQL database username */
define('DB_USER', 'admin user');
/** MySQL database password */
define('DB_PASSWORD', 'admin password');
/** MySQL hostname */
define('DB_HOST', 'localhost');

8.	After successfully importing the DB file into your local MySQL server go to http:///localhost/dimos_thessalonikis/wp-admin and login with the username: admin_dthes and password:THES2014
You should modify the above later.
By now you should be able to see the WP administration dashboard

9.	Download the file ata-settings.txt and open it with a simple text editor. Copy the content.
10.	Go to WP Dashboard -> Appearance ->Atahualpa Theme options and paste the text that you have copied in step 8 and Click Import settings

The “Rating my city” application is ready and you see it in http:///localhost/dimos_thessalonikis/ 

Thank you for trying this web application!
